  Depending on the number and size of PDFs uploaded and your internet connection, AI processing can take some time. Please be patient — progress indicators will keep you updated. 

- **Use:**  
   A maximum of 20 papers can be uploaded at a single time.

- **Use:**  
  The web is hosted on Render and hence users may face **cold starts** wherin the user has to wait **30 seconds** for the web to initialise. 
  As per tool usage, the developer may decide to host it on better sources to avoid such **cold starts**.
